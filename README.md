## Introduction
Our project is a web development based project. 
Addressing the pandemic we decided to make a website on covid. Our website is titled All in one covid portal
The aim of our project is to make a user-friendly website and to  integrate different sites of covid into a single website by using different API’s. 
One of the most common problems faced by today’s people is a lack of knowledge of diseases and a lack of immediate first aid consultation. Due to this many people may suffer from physical and mental stress as they try to figure out the reason for their condition. In some cases, they even lost their lives and common diseases become life-threatening.
In such a scenario, patients are now largely being advised to take online consultations with doctors in the comfort of their own home instead of physical consultations at the hospital in the clinic.
